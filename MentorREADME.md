# Mentor's README

## The motivation for this document
My goal is to put into the open all the thoughts I have, or the questions you might think about. I want you to have a view into my mind, so there is no confusion as to what I expect. I hope it will make your learning journey with me a bit easier ðŸ™‚

## My role
I believe that a big part of my role is to make sure our team works seamlessly without me. Iâ€™m measuring myself by those 2 things:

- **Helping you improve**. Thinking together about a career path you want to pursue, and finding suitable tasks to challenge you. Sometimes, it may require moving to another team, if I feel I have nothing to give to you. 

- **Delivering our work on time** (and in high quality). I try my best to understand the scope, consider the alternatives, estimate correctly - and help you execute. 

## 4 Things I will do (and 1 I won't)
- **Theory Application**: I will help you connect the concepts you learn in your studies with real-world applications and practices.

- **Context Insight**: I will assist you in understanding your current standing within the specific discipline of data science, as well as its intersection with other fields such as software development and business.

- **Personalize Roadmap**: I will provide you with external resources and advice on what to learn and the most effective ways to learn them.

- **Research Skills**: I will teach you how to research solutions to your problems. Since then, I will not provide direct solutions or spend our sessions solving coding problems together.

## Our session
I have 2 goals for our session:
- Catch up on your progress

- Align on your path forward (by giving feedback, discussing problems, or sharing my thoughts)

I prefer to be intentional in the 1:1s with my manager - come up with my topics, share feedback, and push for things I want my manager to move. 

Itâ€™s a great opportunity for you to steer me in the right direction, use it.
